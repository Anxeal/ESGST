/*
 * June 9, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.16
 */

* Changed how the comment history data is stored (your old data should be transferred without any problems, but let me know about any missing data). As a result, the option to import/export comment history data has been temporarily disabled until it is rewritten for the new system.

 */

* Fixed some bugs and made some improvements.

Removed the following features:

* Giveaway Description/Comment Box Popup - Upon clicking the Enter/Leave giveaway button, the script now checks for a description. If it finds one, it opens the giveaway in a new tab so you can read it before entering, otherwise it enters the giveaway automatically.

/*
 * June 2, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.13
 */

* Added the option to show points in the title to Header Refresher, and the option to show an icon in the title to highlight new messages. The icon chosen was "fire", because you got new messages, so you're "hot". If anyone has a better suggestion, feel free to let me know.

* Fixed a bug in Endless Scrolling that was happening while refreshing a page.

* Endless Scrolling no longer alters the title/URL of the page.
* Added/changed some icons in the simplified version of Game Categories.

Upgraded the following features to v6:

* Header Refresher - If multiple tabs are open, only one tab will now make requests to refresh the header and then it will sync the changes with the other tabs (this happens instantly with Tampermonkey). The number of delivered wins will now appear in the title of the tab e.g. (2W). The icon of the tab is no longer changed, the message count will now appear in the title of the tab e.g. (5M). The level on SG and the reputation on ST are now refreshed as well, but they will not appear in the title of the tab. Points are updated instantly and refreshed across all open tabs when using Enter/Leave Giveaway Button with Tampermonkey (with Greasemonkey, it will still update, but only after 60 seconds). An example of all items combined: (2W) (5M) (150P) SteamGifts

/*
 * May 26, 2017 - v6.Beta.3.10
 */

* Added back the option to sync using the Steam API key, but made it optional. If there is a Steam API key saved, it will sync using both Steam API key and login, otherwise it will sync using only login.
* Added the option to enable a simplified version of Game Categories that can either show initials of the categories or icons (suggestions for the icons are always welcome, as I wasn't sure which icon to choose for some categories).

 */

* Added the option to highlight multiple wins as positive to Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker, as multiple wins often cannot be fixed.
* Added the option to color the usernames instead of adding an icon next to them to Whitelist/Blacklist Checker. If this option is enabled, Not Activated/Multiple Wins Checker highlights will automatically appear as icons to avoid conflict.
